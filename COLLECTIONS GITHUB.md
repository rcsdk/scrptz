You're asking a really great question, and I think a lot of people can relate to the idea of trying to find scripts that others have written to solve similar problems, and maybe even share their own in return. So, let's break this down a bit and see what’s going on.

1. Why don't people share scripts more easily?
There are definitely tons of developers and hobbyists who write scripts for personal use, but many people may not think of sharing them, or they might keep them private for a variety of reasons:
- Privacy/Confidentiality: Scripts might be tied to personal or professional projects that involve sensitive information.
- Incompleteness: Sometimes scripts are written as quick solutions to specific problems, and people might feel they aren't polished enough to be shared or might not work universally.
- Lack of motivation: Not everyone thinks about contributing to a public repository, and many may only write scripts when they need them.

2. Are people sharing their Bash scripts?
Yes, absolutely! There are plenty of places where people are sharing scripts and projects related to Linux, Bash scripting, and more:
- GitHub: GitHub is the obvious place where a lot of developers and hobbyists upload their scripts. If you're looking for Bash scripts for tasks like automating terminal tasks, configuring systems, or even interacting with APIs, you can find them there. It might require some searching. Try exploring topics or repositories like [bash-scripts](https://github.com/topics/bash-scripts), or check out repos that contain scripts for system administration, DevOps, or AI integration.
  
  - Example search on GitHub: [Bash scripts repositories](https://github.com/search?q=bash+scripts)
- GitLab: Similar to GitHub, GitLab is another place where people might be sharing their scripts. Some open-source projects are hosted here instead of GitHub, so it's worth checking out.

    GitLab: Similar to GitHub, GitLab is another place where people might be sharing their scripts. Some open-source projects are hosted here instead of GitHub, so it's worth checking out.


    Gist: GitHub's Gist is another place to share small scripts, especially when they’re not tied to large projects. You can easily find individual script snippets shared here by people. It’s less formal than a full repo but still useful for sharing smaller, reusable pieces of code.


    Stack Overflow: While not specifically a repository for scripts, Stack Overflow has an enormous wealth of people posting snippets of Bash scripts to solve specific problems. You can find responses with useful scripts that solve common issues.

    Reddit: Subreddits like r/bash, r/linux, r/commandline, and r/linux4noobs often have people sharing small scripts or ideas for automation that could help in different contexts.


    Dev.to: This is a platform for developers where people often post tutorials and snippets. You’ll find a variety of Bash-related content here, especially related to automation or DevOps tasks.


    Where do people share specialized scripts (like AI interaction)?

Since you mentioned wanting to work on a terminal with AI interaction, this is an emerging field that may not be as widely shared yet, but there are places that encourage these kinds of projects:

Models - Hugging Face
We’re on a journey to advance and democratize artificial intelligence through open source and open science.
huggingface.co

    Hugging Face: Hugging Face has a huge ecosystem of AI models and a lot of people share scripts that interact with models through APIs. If you’re looking for Bash or Python scripts to interact with Hugging Face's models, you can check out their [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models) or their [community forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/) where people discuss and share AI-related code.


    OpenAI: For AI interaction, OpenAI's forums and GitHub repositories could be useful. There, you can find scripts for interacting with language models like GPT, and you might even find shell scripts that call the OpenAI API.

    AI-Related GitHub Repos: Searching GitHub for terms like “AI bash scripts” or “terminal AI interaction” might lead you to some scripts people have shared, especially for interacting with OpenAI, Hugging Face, or other AI APIs.


    Why can’t you find more scripts for hardening Debian or customizing terminal interactions?

    Specialized Areas: Hardening Debian or customizing a terminal for AI interaction are somewhat specialized tasks. You might need to look for specific security repositories or configuration guides (for instance, debian-security lists or hardening repositories on GitHub).

GitHub - CISOfy/lynis: Lynis - Security auditing tool for Linux, macOS, and UNIX-based systems. Assists with compliance testing (HIPAA/ISO27001/PCI DSS) and system hardening. Agentless, and installation optional.

    For hardening Debian specifically, you might want to look at tools like [Lynis](https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis) for auditing or guides like [Debian Security Manual](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/) which provide security best practices.


    Smaller Communities: Some topics might have smaller or more niche communities where people share scripts. For example, security-hardening scripts might not be widely shared on large platforms like GitHub but could be found in security-focused forums or specialized Linux mailing lists.


    What you can do next:

    Explore GitHub more deeply: Use specific search terms like “AI Bash scripts” or “Debian hardening scripts.”

8:05 AM

    Start your own repo: If you have created some useful scripts, you could share them on GitHub for others to use. That would be a great contribution to the community!
    Join niche forums or Slack/Discord communities: These communities are more active in sharing specialized scripts, whether for security, automation, or AI. For example, Linux-specific forums often have people sharing their own scripts for system configurations.
    Contribute to existing repos: Sometimes, adding to existing repositories (like security-focused ones or those related to automation) is a good way to learn and also share your own work.
