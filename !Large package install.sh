 believe you're referring to security tools and applications that are commonly installed on Linux distributions, such as Arch Linux or its customized versions. Here's a list of security applications you might consider installing for a more secure system, like one based on BrickIT (which I assume is a custom version of Arch):

1. System Hardening and Security Tools:

AppArmor or SELinux – Mandatory access control systems to enforce security policies.

ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) – A simple firewall to block unauthorized traffic.

firewalld – Another firewall tool for managing rules and zones.


2. Intrusion Detection and Monitoring:

rkhunter (Rootkit Hunter) – A tool to scan for rootkits on your system.

chkrootkit – A similar tool to check for rootkits.

AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) – Monitors system files and alerts you of changes.

OSSEC – A host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) that actively monitors systems.

Auditd – The Linux Audit daemon, useful for tracking security-relevant events.


3. System Integrity Checkers:

Lynis – A security auditing tool to scan your system and recommend improvements.

Tiger – A security scanner that checks the configuration of your system.

ClamAV – A virus scanner, useful for detecting and removing malware.


4. Encryption Tools:

GPG – For secure email and file encryption.

Cryptsetup – Used to encrypt disk partitions (LUKS encryption).

VeraCrypt – A tool for creating encrypted volumes.


5. Password Management:

KeePassXC – A password manager to store credentials securely.

Bitwarden – Another password manager (with a web vault option).


6. Network Monitoring and Security:

Wireshark – A network protocol analyzer to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.

nmap – A network scanner for security auditing.

netstat – Command to view network connections, helping detect unauthorized ones.

fail2ban – Monitors logs for failed login attempts and bans IPs involved in malicious activities.


7. Privacy Tools:

Tor – For anonymous browsing.

WireGuard or OpenVPN – VPN services to secure your internet connection.

Shadowsocks – A secure proxy tool for bypassing censorship.

Qubes OS – A highly secure, compartmentalized operating system (if you're looking for a more complete approach).


8. Backup and Data Protection:

rsync – A utility for backing up and synchronizing files.

Timeshift – A system restore tool to create backups of the system’s state.

BorgBackup – A deduplicating backup program that works well for encrypted backups.


9. System Monitoring Tools:

htop – An interactive process viewer and manager.

glances – A cross-platform monitoring tool for performance metrics.

auditd – As mentioned, a tool for auditing system logs.


10. Other Useful Tools:

fail2ban – A tool to ban IP addresses that show malicious signs.

sudo – Ensure proper user privilege escalation.

iptables or nftables – For advanced firewall management (if ufw isn't enough).


These tools will help you maintain system integrity, improve privacy, and protect your Arch-based system. Make sure to test and configure them according to your specific needs.
