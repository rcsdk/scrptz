I believe you're referring to security tools and applications that are commonly installed on Linux distributions, such as Arch Linux or its customized versions. Here's a list of security applications you might consider installing for a more secure system, like one based on BrickIT (which I assume is a custom version of Arch):

1. System Hardening and Security Tools:

AppArmor or SELinux – Mandatory access control systems to enforce security policies.

ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) – A simple firewall to block unauthorized traffic.

firewalld – Another firewall tool for managing rules and zones.


2. Intrusion Detection and Monitoring:

rkhunter (Rootkit Hunter) – A tool to scan for rootkits on your system.

chkrootkit – A similar tool to check for rootkits.

AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) – Monitors system files and alerts you of changes.

OSSEC – A host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) that actively monitors systems.

Auditd – The Linux Audit daemon, useful for tracking security-relevant events.


3. System Integrity Checkers:

Lynis – A security auditing tool to scan your system and recommend improvements.

Tiger – A security scanner that checks the configuration of your system.

ClamAV – A virus scanner, useful for detecting and removing malware.


4. Encryption Tools:

GPG – For secure email and file encryption.

Cryptsetup – Used to encrypt disk partitions (LUKS encryption).

VeraCrypt – A tool for creating encrypted volumes.


5. Password Management:

KeePassXC – A password manager to store credentials securely.

Bitwarden – Another password manager (with a web vault option).


6. Network Monitoring and Security:

Wireshark – A network protocol analyzer to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.

nmap – A network scanner for security auditing.

netstat – Command to view network connections, helping detect unauthorized ones.

fail2ban – Monitors logs for failed login attempts and bans IPs involved in malicious activities.


7. Privacy Tools:

Tor – For anonymous browsing.

WireGuard or OpenVPN – VPN services to secure your internet connection.

Shadowsocks – A secure proxy tool for bypassing censorship.

Qubes OS – A highly secure, compartmentalized operating system (if you're looking for a more complete approach).


8. Backup and Data Protection:

rsync – A utility for backing up and synchronizing files.

Timeshift – A system restore tool to create backups of the system’s state.

BorgBackup – A deduplicating backup program that works well for encrypted backups.


9. System Monitoring Tools:

htop – An interactive process viewer and manager.

glances – A cross-platform monitoring tool for performance metrics.

auditd – As mentioned, a tool for auditing system logs.


10. Other Useful Tools:

fail2ban – A tool to ban IP addresses that show malicious signs.

sudo – Ensure proper user privilege escalation.

iptables or nftables – For advanced firewall management (if ufw isn't enough).


These tools will help you maintain system integrity, improve privacy, and protect your Arch-based system. Make sure to test and configure them according to your specific needs.




Here is the final combined table, ensuring all previous and newly added tools, categories, and suggestions are captured in a structured manner. I've carefully integrated everything to make sure nothing is missing. This table now includes all the tools we've discussed, including Wi-Fi penetration tools, system hardening, network monitoring, and other advanced categories like Logging & SIEM, Kernel Monitoring, and more.

Critical Review

This table now contains core security tools, penetration testing tools, and compliance frameworks.

The Wi-Fi penetration testing tools have been added, covering the most important ones from BlackArch and Kali Linux.

Logging and SIEM tools will help you efficiently manage and analyze system logs, critical for detecting unusual activities.

Kernel monitoring and user activity monitoring provide granular control and real-time tracking of system events.

System hardening tools like Grsecurity, PaX, and Bastille Linux give you further control over system security.

Forensics tools have been added for analyzing system traces and recovering from incidents.


If everything looks good to you, this should be a comprehensive setup. Let me know if any further adjustments are required!
