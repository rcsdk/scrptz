code in bash to help me harden my envinroment - im on ram - 16g - booting on system rescue - 4, 5 times a day   booting from a strick to try and work as a designer.
i want to develop 04 scripts. 
01 - preparation offline
02 - download and check all around for breaches - hidden services, hidden connections, opened ports (close all minus http), hidden ssh, kernel, change/refresh literally all confs (and similar) once he tempers all of them including clamav, rk chk etc etc
03 - download and setup all security - firewall, etc etc etc - centralizing all logs - in a single place - minimum files as possible - condensing and creating files based on interpretation of really matters (I always feel there is 90% garbage)
04 - check all the above again - to be sure they are working and will continue to work once malware coming from vram - can temper whatever he wants - creating a lot of confusion - eg. didnt we fix DNS already?? (and the same for EVERYTHING - so its very confusing...)


This is the first - not yet finished. please give your opinion on the overall and improvements suggestions
