Absolutely! Let’s combine everything from the beginning, including all of the refined and simplified suggestions, to give you a clear, full step-by-step guide for creating a tamper-proof, encrypted bootable USB with GRUB, while keeping things as simple and effective as possible.

Full Step-by-Step Guide for Secure Boot Setup on USB Stick

Prerequisites

1. USB Stick with two partitions:

500 MB (FAT32) — for the bootloader (GRUB).

Remaining space EXT4 — for storing your encrypted data (ISOs, tools, etc.).



2. A Linux system to prepare everything.


3. Software/tools needed:

grub, cryptsetup, gparted, and optionally sbsign for Secure Boot.





---

Step 1: Partition the USB Stick

1. Insert the USB stick into your computer.


2. Open a terminal and use lsblk to identify your USB stick, for example, /dev/sdX.

sudo lsblk


3. Use GParted (or parted/fdisk) to create two partitions:

Partition 1 (FAT32): 500 MB for the bootloader.

Partition 2 (EXT4): Remaining space for your encrypted data.


Example steps in GParted:

Select the USB drive.

Create a FAT32 partition of 500MB on the first partition.

Create an EXT4 partition with the remaining space.



4. Confirm with lsblk again to ensure the partitions are correct (e.g., /dev/sdX1 for FAT32 and /dev/sdX2 for EXT4).




---

Step 2: Install GRUB on the USB Stick

1. Mount the FAT32 partition:

sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt


2. Install GRUB (UEFI bootloader) to the FAT32 partition:

sudo grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/mnt --boot-directory=/mnt/boot --removable /dev/sdX


3. Verify the GRUB installation by checking that BOOTX64.EFI exists in /mnt/EFI/BOOT.


4. Unmount the partition:

sudo umount /mnt




---

Step 3: Configure GRUB

1. Create a GRUB configuration file (grub.cfg):

sudo nano /mnt/boot/grub/grub.cfg


2. Add the following minimal configuration to boot a Linux kernel from the encrypted partition:

set timeout=5
set default=0

menuentry "Secure Linux" {
    insmod gzio
    insmod part_gpt
    insmod ext2
    set root=(hd0,gpt2)  # Adjust if necessary
    linux /boot/vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/mapper/secureusb ro quiet
    initrd /boot/initramfs-linux.img
}


3. Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).


4. Optional: Add backup boot entries in case your primary configuration fails (useful for recovery):

menuentry "Backup Kernel" {
    insmod gzio
    insmod part_gpt
    insmod ext2
    set root=(hd0,gpt2)
    linux /boot/vmlinuz-linux-backup root=/dev/mapper/secureusb ro quiet
    initrd /boot/initramfs-linux-backup.img
}




---

Step 4: Encrypt the EXT4 Partition

1. Set up encryption on the EXT4 partition (/dev/sdX2):

sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdX2


2. Open the encrypted partition:

sudo cryptsetup open /dev/sdX2 secureusb


3. Format the partition as EXT4:

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/secureusb


4. Mount the encrypted partition:

sudo mount /dev/mapper/secureusb /mnt


5. Create directories for storing tools and ISOs:

sudo mkdir /mnt/isos /mnt/tools


6. Unmount the partition:

sudo umount /mnt
sudo cryptsetup close secureusb




---

Step 5: Add a GRUB Password (Optional for Security)

1. Generate a password hash:

grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2

Copy the resulting hash (e.g., grub.pbkdf2.sha512...).



2. Edit the GRUB configuration file (grub.cfg) to add the password:

sudo nano /mnt/boot/grub/grub.cfg


3. Add the following lines at the top of the grub.cfg file:

set superusers="root"
password_pbkdf2 root grub.pbkdf2.sha512....


4. Save and exit.




---

Step 6: Make the GRUB Partition Read-Only

1. After configuring GRUB, remount the FAT32 partition as read-only to prevent tampering:

sudo mount -o remount,ro /mnt




---

Step 7: Automate the Mounting of the Encrypted Partition

1. Create a simple script to unlock and mount the encrypted partition:

Create a new file mount_secureusb.sh:

sudo nano /mnt/tools/mount_secureusb.sh

Add the following content:

#!/bin/bash
sudo cryptsetup open /dev/sdX2 secureusb
sudo mount /dev/mapper/secureusb /mnt
echo "Encrypted partition mounted at /mnt"



2. Make it executable:

sudo chmod +x /mnt/tools/mount_secureusb.sh


3. Keep this script on the USB stick for easy access to mount the encrypted partition.




---

Step 8: Test the USB Stick

1. Reboot the system and enter the boot menu (usually F10, F12, or Esc during startup).


2. Select your USB stick as the boot device.


3. GRUB should load, and you should see the boot menu with your “Secure Linux” entry.


4. If everything is correct, the system should boot into your encrypted partition and ask for the passphrase when accessing the encrypted data.




---

Step 9: Keep the USB Stick Secure

1. Make the USB stick physically read-only (if possible).


2. Avoid writing to the GRUB partition after setup to preserve its integrity.




---

Optional: Secure Boot Keys (Advanced)

If you want to take security a step further, you can sign the GRUB bootloader and kernel with Secure Boot keys. This is optional and only necessary if your system has Secure Boot enabled and you want to ensure that only trusted bootloaders are executed.

1. Generate your own keys with sbsign (this part is advanced, and can be skipped if you're unsure about it).




---

Conclusion

With this setup, you now have:

1. A tamper-proof bootloader (GRUB) that is read-only.


2. Encrypted data storage to keep your tools and ISOs safe.


3. A simple script to mount your encrypted partition when needed.


4. GRUB password protection to prevent unauthorized boot modifications.



By following this guide, you ensure a simple yet secure setup for your Galaxy Book 2 Pro without unnecessary complexity. You can also test the setup regularly to make sure everything works as expected.

Here’s a thorough, step-by-step guide tailored for a non-technical user to implement Option 1 on your Galaxy Book 2 Pro using the USB stick with a 500 MB FAT32 partition (for GRUB) and an EXT4 partition (for the rest of the files). This guide ensures a tamper-proof bootloader and encrypted data for maximum security.


---

Prerequisites

1. A Linux environment for preparation (use your current Linux system or a live USB environment).


2. The following software/tools installed:

grub

cryptsetup

gparted (for partitioning verification).



3. Your USB stick with:

500 MB FAT32 partition (for GRUB).

Remaining space as EXT4 (for encrypted storage).





---

1. Verify Your Partitions

1. Insert the USB stick into your computer.


2. Open a terminal and run:

sudo lsblk

Find your USB stick (e.g., /dev/sdX, where X is the letter assigned to your USB).


3. Confirm the partitions:

/dev/sdX1 → 500 MB (FAT32)

/dev/sdX2 → Remaining space (EXT4)




If these partitions are not correct, use a partitioning tool like GParted to fix them. Ensure you set /dev/sdX1 as FAT32 and /dev/sdX2 as EXT4.


---

2. Install GRUB on the USB Stick

1. Mount the FAT32 partition:

sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt


2. Install GRUB for UEFI:

sudo grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/mnt --boot-directory=/mnt/boot --removable /dev/sdX

This installs GRUB as a UEFI bootloader on the USB stick.



3. Verify installation:

ls /mnt/EFI/BOOT

You should see a file named BOOTX64.EFI.


4. Unmount the partition:

sudo umount /mnt




---

3. Configure GRUB for Secure Boot

1. Create a GRUB configuration file:

sudo nano /mnt/boot/grub/grub.cfg


2. Add the following content to load a secure Linux kernel (replace vmlinuz and initrd paths with actual kernel files you'll use):

set timeout=5
set default=0

menuentry "Secure Linux" {
    insmod gzio
    insmod part_gpt
    insmod ext2
    set root=(hd0,gpt2)  # Adjust if necessary
    linux /boot/vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/mapper/secureusb ro quiet
    initrd /boot/initramfs-linux.img
}


3. Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).




---

4. Encrypt the EXT4 Partition

1. Set up encryption on /dev/sdX2:

sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdX2


2. Open the encrypted partition:

sudo cryptsetup open /dev/sdX2 secureusb


3. Format it as EXT4:

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/secureusb


4. Mount the encrypted partition:

sudo mount /dev/mapper/secureusb /mnt


5. Create directories for your ISOs and tools:

sudo mkdir /mnt/isos /mnt/tools


6. Unmount and close the encrypted partition:

sudo umount /mnt
sudo cryptsetup close secureusb




---

5. Test the USB Stick

1. Reboot your laptop and enter the boot menu (usually by pressing F10, F12, or Esc during startup).


2. Select your USB stick as the boot device.


3. GRUB should load and display the menu you configured.


4. If you see your menu entry and can boot into a Linux environment, the setup is working.




---

6. Secure the USB Stick

1. Make the FAT32 partition read-only:

Use a write-protect switch on the USB (if available) or avoid writing to this partition after setup.



2. Always use the encrypted partition for storing sensitive tools and ISOs.
