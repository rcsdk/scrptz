    Themes and Icons: Install themes like Arc or Numix and icon packs like Papirus for a modern look.

    Compositors: Use Picom for smooth animations and transparency.

    App Launchers: Install Rofi or Albert for a quick app launcher.

    Custom Scripts: Add custom scripts for automation (e.g., backup, cleanup).
