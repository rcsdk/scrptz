Here’s a script that will automate the process of downloading and installing all the recommended tools on your system. This script assumes you’re using PacMan on your Arch-based BrickIT system.

Script: install_tools.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Update the system and sync package databases
echo "Updating system and syncing package databases..."
sudo pacman -Syu --noconfirm

# Array of tools to install
TOOLS=(
    # System Recovery & Diagnostics
    "testdisk"
    "parted"
    "gparted"
    "memtest86+"
    "smartmontools"
    "clonezilla"
    
    # Networking Tools
    "nmap"
    "wireshark-gtk"
    "gnu-netcat"
    "curl"
    "inetutils" # Includes ping and traceroute

    # Penetration Testing & Security Tools
    "hydra"
    "john"
    "aircrack-ng"
    "metasploit"
    "gnu-netcat"

    # Disk Encryption & Password Tools
    "cryptsetup"
    "keepassxc"
    "hashcat"

    # File Management & Backup Tools
    "rsync"
    "tar"
    "p7zip"

    # System Monitoring Tools
    "htop"
    "iotop"
    "nmon"
    "sysstat"

    # Disk Recovery & Forensics
    "sleuthkit"
    "foremost"
)

# Install tools
echo "Installing tools..."
for tool in "${TOOLS[@]}"; do
    echo "Installing $tool..."
    sudo pacman -S $tool --noconfirm
done

# Finish up
echo "All tools installed successfully!"
