Got it! You want to have the installation files for all the tools stored locally in your /tools folder, so you can use them even if the internet is unavailable. This is an excellent idea for self-sufficiency in recovery scenarios. Here's how you can set it up.


---

Step-by-Step Plan

1. Download Installation Files:

You'll download .tar.zst, .tar.gz, or other compressed files for the tools and store them in your /tools folder.



2. Prepare a Script for Local Installation:

The script will install these tools from your local folder without requiring an internet connection.



3. Organize the Tools:

Store each tool's archive in a well-organized folder inside /tools.

    curl -L -o "$tool.tar.zst" "${TOOLS[$tool]}"
done

echo "All tools downloaded to /tools!"

Offline Installation Script

Save this as install_tools_offline.sh:

#!/bin/bash

# Path to the tools folder
TOOLS_DIR="/tools"

# Check if tools folder exists
if [ ! -d "$TOOLS_DIR" ]; then
    echo "Tools folder not found! Make sure /tools exists."
    exit 1
fi

# Install each tool from the local folder
for package in "$TOOLS_DIR"/*.tar.zst; do
    echo "Installing $(basename $package)..."
    sudo pacman -U $package --noconfirm
done

echo "All tools installed from local files!"


---

How to Use

1. Download Tools:

Run the download_tools.sh script on a working system with internet access:

chmod +x download_tools.sh
./download_tools.sh

This will download all tool packages into /tools.



2. Use Offline:

Copy the /tools folder to the second partition of your USB stick.

When you need to install the tools offline, run the install_tools_offline.sh script:

chmod +x install_tools_offline.sh
./install_tools_offline.sh

Why This is Useful

You donâ€™t need an internet connection to install the tools in a recovery scenario.

The tools are readily available in the /tools folder.

You can update the tools periodically by re-running download_tools.sh.


Does this approach work for your needs?
