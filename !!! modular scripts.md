You're absolutely right, Daniel. In real-world scenarios, large scripts with tons of interactions can become a nightmare, especially if you're working on something like a free version where token limitations or resource constraints exist. Let's focus on a more practical approach that scales well and ensures you're not getting bogged down by debugging or performance issues. Here's how I would break it down for a real-world, workable solution:

Real-World Approach:

1. Smaller, Modular Scripts

Problem with large scripts: Large scripts with numerous interactive prompts or conditional logic tend to get overly complex, leading to issues when debugging or maintaining them. The more complexity you add, the harder it is to manage.

Solution: Break it down into smaller, independent scripts. Each script should focus on a single diagnostic task (e.g., checking memory, scanning apps, verifying boot kits). These smaller scripts should be simple, fast to test, and independent of each other.

For example:

check_memory.sh: Script to check memory usage.

scan_apps.sh: Script to list and check installed apps.

bootkit_scan.sh: A script to scan for potential bootkits.


User Interaction: Instead of making one massive script with interactive prompts, call the relevant scripts one by one and let the user control which scripts to run. For instance:

echo "Do you want to check memory? (yes/no)"
read user_input
if [ "$user_input" == "yes" ]; then
    ./check_memory.sh
fi



Why this works: This avoids overwhelming complexity, ensuring scripts are easier to maintain, debug, and test. If one script fails, you can easily fix it without worrying about breaking the entire system.

2. Use Simple Text-Based Interaction (No Heavy Dependencies)

Problem with complex UI systems: Tools like Dialog and Tasker add more overhead and dependencies, especially when you're limited on resources. Implementing a full GUI or complex dialog system can lead to frustration, slowdowns, and excessive debugging.

Solution: Stick with simple text-based prompts for interaction, either through basic read statements or using standard terminal menus. For example:

echo "Choose a diagnostic test:"
echo "1. Check Memory"
echo "2. Check Apps"
echo "3. Check Boot Kits"
read choice

case $choice in
    1) ./check_memory.sh ;;
    2) ./scan_apps.sh ;;
    3) ./bootkit_scan.sh ;;
    *)
        echo "Invalid option. Please try again."
        ;;
esac


Why this works: Text-based interaction with numbered menus is simple and avoids external dependencies that can cause headaches. It's intuitive and avoids the complexity of creating advanced UI or integration layers.

3. Use a Centralized Script to Call Subscripts (Instead of Huge Monolithic Scripts)

Problem with all-in-one big scripts: As you've rightly pointed out, large scripts are prone to failure. Building a centralized controller script can be more efficient. This script calls other scripts as needed based on user input, without having to handle every decision in one place.

Solution: Your central script (diagnose.sh) would look like this:

echo "Welcome to Android Diagnostics"
echo "Select the diagnostic you'd like to run:"
echo "1. Memory Check"
echo "2. Application Scan"
echo "3. Bootkit Check"
read choice

case $choice in
    1) ./check_memory.sh ;;
    2) ./scan_apps.sh ;;
    3) ./bootkit_scan.sh ;;
    *)
        echo "Invalid option."
        ;;
esac


Why this works: By having a simple master script, you can easily manage different diagnostic modules without overcomplicating the structure. Each script is independent, which makes debugging much easier.

4. Use Local or Remote Execution for Heavy Lifting (Don't Do Everything on Android)

Problem with Android limitations: Android isn't as powerful as a full Linux environment, so executing resource-intensive diagnostics (like memory dumps or bootkit scans) may be inefficient or slow on the device.

Solution: Set up a remote server (like a Linux box or a cloud instance) where the heavy lifting is done. Your Android device could be used just to trigger the scripts and display results. For example:

Install a remote access tool like JuiceSSH or use a custom app to run the scripts on a remote server.

Run scripts on the server and return results to the Android device, keeping the Android system lightweight and focused on execution rather than resource-intensive tasks.


How to trigger remotely: You can use SSH or API calls to trigger remote diagnostics:

ssh user@remote_server 'bash -s' < check_memory.sh


Why this works: Running diagnostics remotely takes the strain off your Android device and ensures smoother execution of heavy tasks.

5. Automate Input (If You Donâ€™t Need Full Interaction Every Time)

Problem with manual input: Having to type in responses (like "yes/no") every time can slow you down, especially if you're automating repetitive checks.

Solution: For recurring tasks, automate responses to the most common questions by including defaults:

read -p "Do you want to run the memory check? (default: yes): " choice
choice=${choice:-yes}
if [ "$choice" == "yes" ]; then
    ./check_memory.sh
fi


Why this works: This allows for defaults, reducing the need for constant manual input. If the answer is often "yes," the script can run automatically without interruption.

6. Log Results for Later Review (Instead of Immediate Output)

Problem with continuous output: If your diagnostics generate too much output, you might end up scrolling through logs or missing important details.

Solution: Have your scripts log the results to a file and allow you to review them at the end. For example:

./check_memory.sh > memory_log.txt
./scan_apps.sh > apps_log.txt
./bootkit_scan.sh > bootkit_log.txt
echo "Logs have been saved. Review them anytime."


Why this works: Logs make the results easier to review at your convenience, without overwhelming you with too much information at once.


---

Conclusion:

Keep things modular: Break scripts into small, manageable chunks that can be easily executed and tested.

Use simple interaction: Text-based prompts (with default answers where possible) ensure minimal complexity and less chance of breaking.

Remote execution: Offload resource-heavy tasks to a remote server or cloud instance, allowing your Android device to focus on triggering diagnostics.

Log results: Save outputs to log files for easier management and debugging.


This approach is grounded in real-world use, focusing on practicality, efficiency, and avoiding unnecessary complexity. It ensures that you're able to run diagnostics smoothly without needing to constantly deal with debugging or re-executing massive scripts.
