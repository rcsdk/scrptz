Thank you for providing the diagnostics. I’ll carefully assess the details to plan the next steps for hardening rEFInd and securing your boot environment against this persistent bootkit.

Before proceeding, let’s establish critical goals based on your situation:  

1. **Create an Untamperable Boot Process:** Aim to isolate rEFInd and secure the bootloader files against modification.  
2. **Work Securely on RAM:** Since you’re booting from a USB and working in RAM, we will focus on ensuring integrity during every boot.  
3. **Neutralize Malware's Ability to Persist:** Prevent the bootkit from interfering by minimizing attack vectors and monitoring for tampering.

### **Initial Assessment & Strategic Steps**
Here’s how we’ll proceed strategically:

1. **Assess and Secure rEFInd Configuration**  
   - Review the `refind.conf` and ensure it has no unnecessary or vulnerable configurations.
   - Disable unneeded features like mouse or touchscreen support unless essential.  
   - Check if your `timeout` settings allow the bootkit to execute malicious processes. Setting it to `0` for instant boot or `-1` might help.

2. **Verify Bootloader Integrity**  
   - Revalidate the integrity of `/boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind_x64.efi` using the SHA256 hash already provided. Compare it against a known-good source from [rEFInd GitHub](https://github.com) or other trusted archives.  
   - Ensure the `refind_x64.efi` file isn’t overwritten by unverified binaries.

3. **Secure the EFI Partition**  
   - Mount `/boot/efi` as read-only after verifying its integrity:  
     ```bash
     mount -o remount,ro /boot/efi
     ```
   - Verify if this change persists during the runtime to block tampering by the bootkit.

4. **Evaluate Boot Order and NVRAM**  
   - Use `efibootmgr` to validate the boot order and remove unwanted boot entries created by the bootkit:  
     ```bash
     efibootmgr -v
     efibootmgr -b <entry_num> -B
     ```  
     Replace `<entry_num>` with IDs corresponding to suspicious entries.

5. **Enhance rEFInd Security**  
   - Utilize Secure Boot or a shim loader for rEFInd. Ensure it’s signed with your custom key to block unauthorized binaries.  
   - Configure rEFInd to avoid scanning for unnecessary boot entries:
     ```bash
     scanfor manual
     ```
     Add specific stanzas for your trusted OS.

6. **Monitor EFI Variables for Tampering**  
   - Use the provided `ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars` data to identify variables related to unauthorized boot options. Document changes during every session.

7. **Rebuild the USB Boot Stick**  
   - Generate a fresh, clean USB bootable disk using a trusted system. Ensure it includes only trusted binaries and rEFInd files. Use tools like `Ventoy` or `dd`.

8. **Enable Logging and Alert Mechanisms**  
   - Configure rEFInd to log all actions:  
     ```bash
     log_level 4
     ```
   - Regularly inspect the log files in `/boot/efi/EFI/refind`.
